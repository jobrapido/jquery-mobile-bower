If you want to use [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) via [Bower](http://bower.io) this is the easiest way.  The JQuery Mobile project iself requires a build process in order to assemble the most effective controls for your mobile project, which is likely the best approach for production systems in most cases, but may not be appropriate for simpler projects or projects that have yet to invest in a client-side build process.  This repository contains the most recent JQuery Mobile CSS and JS files for easy component integration, including all the JQuery Mobile controls and base themes.
